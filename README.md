Session 3 Example

Hi! My name is James "Jim" Reeves from Sequim WA. My background consists of 15 years in the aerospace industry followed
by 5 years in the real estate industry.

My career goals are to parlay my existing skill-sets with the new skill-sets learned here into a Investment Advisor
role for crypto and blockchain, or develop my own blockchain, or both.

I chose FinTech as a career path because I see nothing but a bright future in it, I am really interested in it, and this
will future proof my career as well.
